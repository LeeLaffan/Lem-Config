# Lem User Configuration

This is my configuration for Lem. I worked it out from the descriptions here, and the example configs posted at the bottom of the page:
https://lem-project.github.io/usage/configuration/#site-init
    
I place these files and dirs in ~/.lem

Files in src are not loaded unless added to the module in lem-site-init.asd
